- pt_src_mask: takes a map (with beam given) and a list of point sources, applies a flux cut to the source catalog, and masks all pixels within a given multiple of FWHM of each source
- diff_inpaint: takes a masked map and diffusively inpaints the mask using the pixels surrounding the mask border (operates on the whole mask simultaneously, i.e., not source-by-source)
